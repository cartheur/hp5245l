The Model 5245L Electronic Counter is a solid-state instrument that can measure frequency, period, multiple period average, ratio, and multiple ratio. It can also be used to scale (divide) a frequency by decades. Plugins, which go directly into the front panel, extend frequency measurments and permit time interval measurements, such as the 5263A shown here. This counter offers a counting rate of 50 MHz with eight-digit resolution.

The Model 5263A permits the 5245L to make time interval measurements. It measures pulse length, spacing and delays, and it triggers from separate or common signals. `START` and `STOP` triggers can be set for `+` or `-` input signals from either single or dual input lines. This may also be used as an amplitude discriminator, counting only signals that exceed the trigger level setting. Time is read from the coutner with units and decimal point indicated.
